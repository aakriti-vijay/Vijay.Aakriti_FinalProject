# Investigating Hypoxia at Oregon Offshore
This research project focuses on understanding and analyzing hypoxia off the coast of Oregon. By examining the correlation between upwelling events and reduced dissolved oxygen during the summer months due to increased stratification, the study aims to uncover the intricate dynamics that contribute to the occurrence of hypoxic conditions in the offshore region. This investigation holds significant implications for marine ecosystems and environmental management strategies in the area.
